# Samplificator
SpringSampling is a small project designed to manage lizards samples project.

## About
This project aims to demonstrate the ability to work with Spring-boot / Reactjs / PostgreSQL,
as a part of an interview task[...]. That's why the project was completed but not uploded on server
since that. (Many thanks to the interviewer who was a source of inspiration). All project's data 
are "a bit fake", and just used for demo purpse only. Thanks for your support and enjoy it :)
